py4all 
This Python project provides a GUI application to scan Python files within a directory and subdirectories for missing modules, offering an option to automatically install the missing modules using pip. The app supports threaded scanning of directories, displaying missing modules, and providing installation options in a separate window.

Features
Directory Scanning: Allows users to select a directory and scan all Python files for missing modules.
Missing Modules Detection: Identifies which modules are imported but not installed.
Module Installation: Automatically installs the missing modules using pip.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Tkinter for a simple, user-friendly interface.
Asynchronous Installation: Handles module installation asynchronously to keep the UI responsive. 



How to Use
Browse for a directory: Click on the "Browse" button and select the directory you want to scan for missing Python modules.
Start Scanning: Click the "Scan" button to begin scanning the selected directory. The app will scan all Python files in the directory for imported modules that are not installed.
View Missing Modules: The app will display the missing modules in a list and show additional information in the text box.
Install Missing Modules: Click the "Install All Missing Modules" button to automatically install the missing modules.
